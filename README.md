## What Is ContractGroup__c?

ContractGroup__c is used in CPQ to group multiple active contracts together—allowing CPQ to co‑term them and renew them through a single renewal opportunity and quote. One of the grouped contracts is designated as the Master Contract, which dictates the co‑term behavior (like choosing the renewal date).

## What Is Cancel & Replace?

The Cancel & Replace functionality is a customizable framework—originally released by Salesforce Labs—that enables advanced contract manipulation in Salesforce CPQ. It’s designed for scenarios where you want to:

Cancel existing contracts using negative orders, and Create new replacement contracts with consolidated subscription terms and extended durations.
This pattern is often referred to as “rip-and-replace.”

<ul> <li>“Cancel & Replace” is a Salesforce Labs framework to cancel existing subscriptions (via negative orders) and create a fresh contract through replacement deals.</li>
<li>It’s widely used for contract consolidation and mid-term restructuring when CPQ’s out-of-the-box renewal isn’t sufficient.</li>

<li>Setup involves installing the package or using the GitHub version, and you should expect to augment it with custom logic to suit your business needs.</li></ul>





# Salesforce CPQ: Contract Consolidation Approaches

## 1. ContractGroup__c + Master Contract

### What It Is
A standard Salesforce CPQ technique for consolidating multiple active contracts into a single renewal contract.

You group contracts via the `ContractGroup__c` field, and designate one as the **Master Contract**. This controls co‑term behavior—typically using the contract with the earliest end date for renewal timing.

### Use Case
Best used **at renewal time**, when you want to streamline multiple contracts into one to simplify billing, quoting, and lifecycle management.

CPQ automates proration, line combination (e.g., *Combine Subscription Quantities*), and pricing roll‑through.  
*Sources: Salesforce Documentation, Cloud Giants*

### Benefits
- Fully supported out-of-the-box by Salesforce CPQ—no custom code needed.
- Cleaner lifecycle with one renewal opportunity and quote, improving forecasting and simplification.  
*Sources: Trailhead, Cloud Giants, Salesforce, Medium, milomassimo.com*
- Preserves integrity of existing data and CPQ pricing models.

### Considerations
- Requires manual setup of `ContractGroup__c` and Master Contract; this can be error‑prone unless automated.  
*Sources: Salesforce AppExchange, Cloud Giants, Trailhead*
- Only applies at renewal—not ideal if you need to merge contracts mid-term.
- If contracts have widely varying end dates, co‑term logic must be carefully managed.

## 2. Cancel & Replace (Salesforce Labs)

### What It Is
A Lab-managed, customized framework for Salesforce CPQ that allows **mid-term restructuring of contracts**.

It *cancels* existing contracts by creating negative-order amendments and then creates a new replacement opportunity, quote, and contract.  
*Sources: Trailhead, AptClouds*

### Use Case
Ideal when you must **merge, re-term, or adjust contracts mid-term**—outside the standard renewal window.

Allows combining multiple contracts into one new version immediately, not waiting for renewal cycles.

### Benefits
- Flexible and powerful—can handle complex scenarios where standard CPQ processes fall short.
- Supports rebuilding contract terms with updated start/end dates, pricing, and product sets.

### Considerations
- Requires installation and customization, and may not support features like MDQ out-of-the-box.  
*Sources: milomassimo.com, Cloud Giants*
- Negative-order amendments can lock fields or introduce confusion if not well managed.
- Maintenance overhead is higher — you’ll likely need to wrap it with custom logic or UI for better UX.

## Quick Comparison Table

| Scenario                                | Best Approach                          | Reason |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|
| Consolidate multiple contracts at renewal | **ContractGroup__c with Master Contract** | Seamless, supported flow within standard CPQ renewal process |
| Merge contracts mid-term or outside renewal | **Cancel & Replace (Salesforce Labs)** | Allows cancellation and rebuild in one go |
| Simplify future billing & quoting       | **ContractGroup__c**                   | Reduces proliferation of contracts over time |
| Require complex restructuring now       | **Cancel & Replace**                   | Flexibility to modify terms, dates, products mid-cycle |

---

## Recommendation
- Prefer using **ContractGroup__c** for renewal-time consolidation—it’s efficient, supported, and scalable.
- Choose **Cancel & Replace** when you need mid-cycle contract reconstruction, merge multiple contracts outside renewal, or extend terms immediately.
